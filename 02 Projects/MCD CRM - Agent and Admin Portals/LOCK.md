# Execution Lock — MCD CRM

Only the holder may commit, merge, deploy, run migrations, or change settings on `hpintojr/crm.mcd`.
Others read/verify only. See `[C] AI Operating Protocol — Handoff, Changelog, Indexing.md` and
`02 Projects/MCD CRM - Agent and Admin Portals/[C] ChatGPT-to-Claude Handoff Protocol — Composio Mandate.md`.

holder: chatgpt
scope: hpintojr/crm.mcd + hpintojr/My-Workspace
since: 2026-07-12T06:40Z (Hamilton directed ChatGPT to take over while Claude usage is unavailable until Monday 9:00 AM Pacific and to complete as much as possible end to end without human intervention)
previous_holder: claude (2026-07-12T06:38Z through 2026-07-12T06:40Z. No additional Claude work was recorded after PR #102.)
intent: ChatGPT continues autonomous implementation, PR, CI, merge, deployment verification, and handoff. PRs #103-#123 are complete and deployed. Continue only with evidence-backed code hardening, regression coverage, read-only dashboards, and operator UX that do not require production mutations, external workflow calls, migrations, or settings changes. Current next scope: harden protected CSV/download response metadata through a download-specific helper, preserving filenames, content types, columns, query bounds, and export AuditLog evidence. Do not invoke exports. Do not apply the staged Commission migration, change production feature flags, identify or use the two Servicing onboarding candidates, mutate production Leads/Client Accounts/Service Cases/acceptance records, call live GHL, activate payment providers, release payouts, store financial-account data, or move money.
```

## Authorized without further owner approval

- Add protected read-only Next.js pages and API GET endpoints.
- Add navigation, source-derived summaries, deep links, and operational matrices.
- Add regression guards and wire them into CI/build.
- Add GitHub Actions for non-mutating smoke tests and repository validation.
- Add opt-in or disposable-branch database test harnesses that never target production.
- Run read-only production database/catalog queries.
- Improve operator UX, observability, request/response boundaries, expected-error handling, and retire unused bypass routes without changing supported business-rule outcomes or mutating production records during deployment.
- Create branches, PRs, run CI, squash-merge after all required checks pass, and verify Vercel production deployments.
- Close clearly superseded draft PRs only after confirming they are not current work.
- Write `[G]` daily logs after each merged PR or significant investigation.

## Not authorized without a more specific Hamilton instruction

- Creating, launching, reassigning, or otherwise mutating production Client Accounts.
- Creating, responding to, resolving, or otherwise mutating production Service Cases.
- Recording production Servicing or Commission acceptance outcomes.

## Repository hygiene

The obsolete draft PRs #1, #6, #7, #8, #9, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #16, and #17 were confirmed superseded, commented, and closed without merge.

## Current production baseline

- Latest production commit: `7b3d22756349863e7623ff76dd7d09d6cb28e913` (PR #123).
- Vercel deployment: `dpl_FadS48Mpiqsw4iCjX3Ev3KuwsfUm`, READY and aliased to `crm.mercurycalldesk.com`.
- `/api/status`: HTTP 200, environment `production`, branch `main`, exact PR #123 merge SHA, no-store, noindex, and the complete security-header baseline intact.
- No protected report, aging preview, CSV/download, authenticated Integration Health snapshot, signup, activation, portal write, controlled-test, import, cron, or GHL webhook POST route was invoked during preview or production verification.
- Vercel reported no runtime errors in the latest one-hour window after deployment.
- PR #109 did not invoke the production cron; the expanded readiness window awaits a later independent scheduled or specifically authorized run.
- Lead Flow: 18/18 acceptance PASS and owner decision recorded.
- Project Readiness: live at `/admin/project-readiness`.
- Integration Health: live at `/admin/integrations/health`, protected aggregate-only.
- Servicing preflight: live at `/admin/servicing/acceptance-command-center`; expected decision `OWNER_AUTHORIZATION_REQUIRED`.
- Production Servicing state: two aggregate onboarding candidates, zero Client Accounts, zero Service Cases, zero Servicing acceptance records.
- Commission/Payout production schema: cleanly staged only; 0 of 7 tables and no current or legacy Commission enum types.

## Current branch state

- PR #123 branch `agent/lead-acceptance-report-boundary` is merged.
- No new implementation branch is currently active.
- Next planned branch: protected CSV/download response metadata boundary, preserving all export bodies and audit evidence.

## Lock return protocol

At the end of this execution interval, ChatGPT must update this file, write a complete `[G]` handoff log, record every merged PR and the latest verified production commit, and return the holder to Claude unless Hamilton directs otherwise.
