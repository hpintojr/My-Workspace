# Execution Lock — MCD CRM

Only the holder may commit, merge, deploy, run migrations, or change settings on `hpintojr/crm.mcd`.
Others read/verify only. See `[C] AI Operating Protocol — Handoff, Changelog, Indexing.md`.

```txt
holder: chatgpt
scope: hpintojr/crm.mcd + hpintojr/My-Workspace
since: 2026-07-10T23:30Z (owner-authorized continuation after Hamilton said "continue coding")
previous_holder: claude (lock had been returned to Claude at 2026-07-10T23:18Z after ChatGPT
                 shipped PR #80, #81, #82, and #83 under the authorized read-only/admin-navigation/guard scope.
                 Latest shipped production commit at lock retake:
                 5b4782611d8122150b70c386dc9eb27c334d7a0f.)
intent: Continue within the same authorized read-only/admin-navigation/guard scope. Next safe backlog
        candidate is /admin/leads/acceptance-diff. Authenticated production acceptance and owner
        production decision remain Hamilton-only. Ship only after all four required checks are green,
        verify Vercel production, write the required [G] daily log, and return the lock to Claude at
        the end of the window.
```

## Authorized without further owner approval

- Add read-only Next.js pages under `src/app/admin/leads/…` or `src/app/admin/…` (server
  component + `requireRole(ADMIN_ROLES)` + `features.leads` gate + `dynamic = "force-dynamic"`).
- Add read-only API GET endpoints that only read `db.auditLog` / `db.lead` and never mutate.
- Add navigation links between existing admin surfaces.
- Extend `scripts/check-lead-flow-alignment.ts` with `assertContains` guard assertions.
- Add anchor `id` attributes for hash-linked deep navigation on existing pages.
- Add or improve read-only summaries, tables, timelines, or matrices sourced from existing data.
- Squash-merge each PR only when all four CI checks are `success` (Vercel Preview Comments,
  policy-check, Typecheck and contract guards, build). Never merge on a red or in-progress check.
- Write a `[G] 2026-07-10 MCD CRM PR#… …` handoff log to `hpintojr/My-Workspace`
  `01 Daily Logs/` after every merged PR. Include PR head, merge commit, production commit
  from `/api/status`, the smoke-test results, and the safety-boundary reaffirmation.

## Not authorized — still requires Hamilton before any action

- Prisma schema changes.
- Neon migrations or Neon branch mutations that touch production data.
- Feature flag changes.
- Live GHL workflow activation or live GHL API calls.
- Live import or export submission.
- Lead claim, DNC, ownership, approval, suppression, or two-way-contact business-rule changes.
- Servicing, Commissions, Finance, payout, or client-onboarding activation.
- Changes to CLAUDE.md's Protected Workspace Command Registry.
- Committing secrets, credentials, customer data, SSNs, tax IDs, or raw bank data.
- Claiming a root cause without direct evidence (build, query, diff, live test).

## Lock return protocol

At end of the owner-authorized continuation, ChatGPT must:

1. Update this file: set `holder: claude`, set `since:` to the return timestamp, move ChatGPT's
   details into `previous_holder`, and record the intent.
2. Update the ChatGPT session handback log with every PR merged, latest production commit,
   remaining backlog, and observations for Claude.
3. Commit both to `main` on `hpintojr/My-Workspace`.
